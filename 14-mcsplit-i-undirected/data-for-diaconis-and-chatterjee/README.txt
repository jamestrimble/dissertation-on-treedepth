one-run-to-45.txt is a single run.  The x column relates to an old version of D&C's arXiv paper and should be ignored.

32-summary.txt: : This shows the results of finding the MCIS of two n-vertex graphs, for n up to 32, with the experiment repeated 100 times. For example, the row "20 11 12 11.09" is for pairs of 20-vertex graphs, and shows that the smallest MCIS had 11 vertices, the largest had 12 vertices, and the mean order of an MCIS was 11.09.

32-results.txt: This is the raw data behind 32-summary.txt. Each row shows the order of an MCIS for a pair of 1-vertex graphs, a pair of 2-vertex graphs, and so on. On each row of the file, the graphs were grown by adding a vertex each time.
