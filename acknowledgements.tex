I would like to thank my three supervisors for their guidance and support during the course of my PhD.  (Until late 2020, Patrick Prosser was my first supervisor and David Manlove was my second supervisor; for the remainder of my PhD, David was my first supervisor and Ciaran McCreesh my second.)  All three supervisors gave me a huge amount of their time, and were infectious in their curiosity and enthusiasm for scientific discovery.

The School of Computer Science has been a fun and welcoming place to study, and I appreciate the friendship of my office mates and the common-room crossword/jigsaw/lunch gang.
I also loved all the Thursday lunchtime ``wee curries'' and the Thursday afternoon cups of tea.
I should single out Ciaran and Craig for their friendship and support through both the good times and the tough parts.

My family have been unbelievably supportive through the whole PhD process, and I'm incredibly grateful for all you've done. Averil, thank you for always being encouraging and for giving me helpful pep talks, and for never once wishing that I hadn't taken this project on. Mum and Dad, thank you for making so many journeys to Scotland to look after us all, and for all the delicious meals. Ailsa, Esther, and Martha, thank you for filling these years with joy and giving me something much more important to do than study.
