This dissertation has the following thesis.

\emph{The structure of the induced subgraph isomorphism and maximum common
subgraph problems allows us to use specialised, compressed data structures to
efficiently represent domains in a backtracking algorithm; by using these
structures we can design algorithms that run faster than the existing state of
the art on many instance classes.}
