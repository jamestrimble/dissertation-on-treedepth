The structure of the induced subgraph isomorphism and
maximum common subgraph problems allows us to use specialised,
compressed data structures to efficiently represent domains
in a backtracking algorithm; these data structures can be built
into algorithms that run faster than the existing state of
the art on many instance classes.
