\begin{center} {\bf Publications and Authorship}\end{center}

During the course of my PhD I carried out further work
that is not presented in this thesis.
For completeness, the following is a full list of publications
since the start of my PhD.

\Cref{c:mcsplit-i-undirected} of this dissertation contains material from the
first publication on the list.  I was the lead author of this paper, which was
co-authored by Ciaran McCreesh and Patrick Prosser.
Ciaran McCreesh carried out the experimental comparison of \McSplit\ with
existing solvers which forms the basis of \Cref{sec:mcsplit-experiments} in
this dissertation.

I was the sole author of all other chapters of this dissertation.
