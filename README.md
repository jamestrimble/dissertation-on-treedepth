# Partitioning Algorithms for Induced Subgraph Problems

This repository contains the LaTeX source for James Trimble's PhD thesis at
the University of Glasgow.

## Source code

- [McSplit and McSplitâ†“](https://github.com/jamestrimble/ijcai2017-partitioning-common-subgraph/)

- [McSplit variants in chapter 4](14-mcsplit-i-undirected/modified-mcsplit-experiment/james-cpp-modified)

- [McSplit-SI](https://github.com/jamestrimble/mcsplit-si)

- [Induced Universal Graphs](https://github.com/jamestrimble/small-universal-graphs)

## Instances

- [New instances in Chapter 4](14-mcsplit-i-undirected/modified-mcsplit-experiment)

- The data used to generate the heatmaps in Chapters 3 and 5 may be reproduced by running the programs in
the following directories:
(Chapter 3)[14-mcsplit-i-undirected/deg_sorting_experiment_fine_grained],
(Chapter 5)[14b-mcsplit-induced-si/deg_sorting_experiment_fine_grained].
