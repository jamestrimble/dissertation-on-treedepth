-Page 9: consider adding a citation for the properties of E-R graphs

-Figure 3.6: please remind readers that the grey bands represent time-outs

-Page 51: please clarify what is meant by ‘unconnected’ in the description of k-down.

-Page 61: (bottom of this page) make sure you define the symbol that is composed of two orthogonal lines. 

-Page 64:  when  mentioning  an  instance in  which labels  are  all distinct:  clarify  what  is  meant  here.    If  all labels are distinct and the labels must match, then isn't the problem instance straightforward?

-Page 72: “the plot use” --> ‘the plots use’

-Page 109: clarify what is meant by ‘words’ of additional space

-Page 108:  please confirm: the larger nodes in the figure are just to contain the larger labels and have no other meaning?

-(very optional) Page 44: carefully consider the proof here, and consider adding a more formal proof that the search trees are the same, perhaps including a bijection between nodes of the search trees.

-Sometime  after  page  60:  consider  adding  a  table  that  summarises  the  results  in  terms  of when  to  use which approach. 

-Consider commenting on the very-dense/very-sparse duality we discussed in the viva: will an approach for  an  induced  subgraph  problem  that  works  very  well  in  the dense  setting  also  work  very  well  in  the sparse setting by working in the complement?

-On page 9, consider expanding the section on isomorphism and subgraph notions for directed graphs: e.g. must direction be preserved?

-Similarly on page 9, consider expanding on the adjacency matrix discussion for directed graphs

-In discussion of figure 2.5 -might be nice to include a proof that the solution in (b) is minimum

-For subgraph isomorphism especially, consider highlighting theresults on the harder instances (those that take, say, more than a second) and discuss why we might nevertheless still care about performance on the easier instances.


## DONE

-The candidate should expand the description of the Glasgow Subgraph Solver, in particular making clear the role and use of supplementary graphs.  

-The  candidate  should  investigate  the  related  work  by  Jefferson  et  al  using  a  related  approach  for computational group theory

-Check to make sure that where possible you link or cite sources of benchmark instances (apologies if this is already done everywhere)
(already done)
In sections 3.5, 5.8.2, 5.8.3 and 5.8.4 already

-Title page: don’t forget to update month and year

-There are quite a few blank pages between sections –is this a typesetting problem?  Fix if it is easy to do so
(was twoside)

-Beginning of 2.2: “two element subset” --> ‘two element subsets’

-Page 9: “are mutually adjacent” consider “are pairwise adjacent”, I believe this is more standard

-Page  9:  consider  emphasising  that  labels  may  be  shared  between  vertices  if  this  is  so  (in  some  areas labeled graphs mean graphs in which each node has a unique label)

-Section 2.4: here you use ‘unsatisfiable’ as a synonym for a “No” instance of a problem –consider defining this earlier, as non-CP folk could read this
Added a definition of a satisfiable (in passing) in the second paragraph of 1.3.

-Page 13:  ‘strongly connected graphs’ -it appears the graph in question is not directed, and usually this term  is  used  for  directed  graphs.    Clarify  either  that  the  graph  is  directed  or  what  strongly  connected means here
This was an error. I have deleted "strongly"

-Page 39: consider clarifying or reminding what ‘incumbent’ means –is this similar to a best-so-far notion?

-Page 43, Theorem 1 (and surrounding text) please consider changing the notation here as discussed in the viva to avoid the second use of G, H, and to make clear that they are vertex sets in the description of P.  Please also consider adding both plan-language intuition for what P is, as well as an example. 
## Maybe not do?

-If possible, increase the font size in figures.


## Additional changes I'd like to make

- Update repo and link to it

- Shorten thesis title
DONE
